## 🧭 Overview

Build a **mobile-first app** called **Kin**, a **Christian-inspired family wellness & workout accountability platform** designed to help families stay consistent, spiritually grounded, and physically active.

## 📱 **App Structure (3 Pages Max in Navbar)**

### 1️⃣ **Home (Dashboard / Today Tab)**

  > “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart.” – Colossians 3:23
* **Streak Ring** — visual ring showing days in a row
* **Check-In Button:** large, central “I Worked Out” button

  * Tap → camera opens → upload photo proof
  * AI (OpenAI Vision) validates gym/workout context

### 2️⃣ **Family (Community / Leaderboard)**

**Purpose:** family accountability and motivation

**Features:**

## 🧱 **Architecture & Tech Stack**

* **AI Vision:** OpenAI API for photo verification (gym/workout context)
* **Health Data:** Apple HealthKit integration for daily step count
* **Notifications:** Expo Notifications for streak reminders
* **Storage:** Supabase buckets for photo proofs (private access)

---

## 🗂 **Core Database Tables**

* `users` → id, name, email, avatar_url
* `families` → id, name, owner_id
* `family_members` → family_id, user_id, role
* `checkins` → id, user_id, family_id, date, proof_url, verification_status
* `points` → id, user_id, family_id, points, source
* `badges` → id, code, name, description

---

## ⚙️ **AI Vision Verification Flow (OpenAI)**

1. User submits workout photo → upload to Supabase Storage
2. Serverless Edge Function sends image to OpenAI
3. OpenAI returns JSON: `{ isVerified: true, confidence: 0.93 }`
4. If `isVerified=true && confidence>0.8` → mark verified ✅
5. Award points, update streak, trigger confetti animation 🎉

Prompt Example:

```
You are verifying whether a photo shows a person working out or in a gym/fitness setting.
Return JSON: { "isVerified": true/false, "confidence": 0–1, "reason": "string" }.
```

## 🔔 **Reminders & Notifications**

* Daily: “Don’t break your streak! Stay grounded, stay strong ⚓️”
* Weekly Summary: “Your family completed 85% of their goals this week — praise and progress!”
* Verse Push: short scripture drop mid-week
